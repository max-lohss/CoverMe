Finding the right health insurance plan is complicated and frustrating. We are solving this problem by building an insurance optimization platform based on what matters most to you.

The code presents users with an intake form, so that they can describe their health in their own terms. By using random forest regression to analyze the health data of our sample population, this code creates an estimate of the cost of coverage in a given year. Using the random forest, the software can estimate the user's overall healthcare cost in a given year. From there it will analyze the price points of four UPMC employee healthcare plans to figure out the cheapest option while considering the user's personal preferences.
